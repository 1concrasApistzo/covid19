1. **Update DirectX**. The most common and effective solution for this error is to install the latest version of DirectX from Microsoft's website. This will replace any missing or outdated DirectX files on your system, including D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll. You can download DirectX from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35). Alternatively, you can also check if your game disc has a DirectX installer and run it.
2. **Download D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll**. If updating DirectX doesn't work, you can try downloading the D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll file individually from a reliable source and placing it in the appropriate folder. You can find a trusted download link for this file from [here](https://www.dll-files.com/d3dcompiler_43.dll.html). After downloading the file, you need to copy it to the Max Payne 3 installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Max Payne 3. You may also need to copy it to the System32 folder (for 32-bit Windows) or SysWOW64 folder (for 64-bit Windows) in C:\Windows.
3. **Run a DISM scan**. Sometimes, the error might be caused by corrupted system files that interfere with DirectX. To fix this, you can run a DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan that will repair any damaged files on your system. To do this, you need to open Command Prompt as an administrator and type the following command: `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`. Press Enter and wait for the scan to complete. Then, restart your computer and try running Max Payne 3 again.
4. **Roll back your PC**. If none of the above methods work, you might have to resort to rolling back your PC to a previous restore point when Max Payne 3 was working fine. This will undo any recent changes that might have triggered the error. To do this, you need to open Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > System Protection. Click on System Restore and follow the instructions to choose a restore point. Note that this will delete any programs or files that you installed or modified after the restore point, so make sure you back up your important data before proceeding.
