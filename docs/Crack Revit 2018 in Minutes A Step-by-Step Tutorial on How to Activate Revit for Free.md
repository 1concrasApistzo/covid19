## Modeling in Revit 2018
 
Revit 2018 allows you to model shapes, structures, and systems in 3D with parametric accuracy, precision, and ease. You can use a variety of tools and commands to create walls, floors, roofs, doors, windows, stairs, railings, furniture, and more. You can also apply materials, colors, patterns, and textures to your elements to enhance their appearance.
 
One of the main features of Revit 2018 is the ability to create families, which are custom components that can be reused and modified throughout your project. Families can be loaded from libraries or created from scratch using the Family Editor. You can also use parameters to control the dimensions, properties, and behavior of your families.
 
Another feature of Revit 2018 is the ability to create adaptive components, which are flexible families that can adapt to different contexts and conditions. Adaptive components can be used for complex geometry, such as curved surfaces, organic shapes, or parametric forms. You can also use adaptive components for conceptual design and massing studies.
 
## Documentation in Revit 2018
 
Revit 2018 helps you streamline documentation work by using built-in automation for generating plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules, and sheets. As you make changes to your model, Revit 2018 automatically updates your documentation to reflect the latest design intent. You can also use annotations, tags, dimensions, symbols, notes, and legends to add information and clarity to your drawings.
 
One of the benefits of Revit 2018 is the ability to create views and sheets that are coordinated and consistent across your project. You can use view templates to apply standard settings and filters to your views. You can also use view references to link views on different sheets. You can also use scope boxes and crop regions to control the extent and visibility of your views.
 
Another benefit of Revit 2018 is the ability to create 3D views and renderings that showcase your design in a realistic and engaging way. You can use cameras and walkthroughs to capture different perspectives and angles of your model. You can also use lighting, shadows, sun settings, backgrounds, and effects to enhance the mood and atmosphere of your scenes. You can also use AutodeskÂ® Rendering service to create photorealistic images and animations of your project.
 
## Conclusion
 
Revit 2018 is a versatile BIM software that can help you create high-quality architectural designs. By using Revit 2018 for modeling and documentation, you can improve your productivity, accuracy, and collaboration on your projects.
