Why is the Al Madinah Mushaf important?
 
The Al Madinah Mushaf is important because it preserves the original text of the Quran as it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and compiled by his companions. The Al Madinah Mushaf follows the Uthmani script, which is the oldest and most widely accepted script of the Quran. The Uthmani script was standardized by Uthman ibn Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), the third caliph of Islam, who ordered the production of a uniform copy of the Quran and distributed it to various regions of the Muslim world. The Uthmani script has 15 special symbols that indicate the rules of tajweed, which are the proper pronunciation and recitation of the Quran. By reading the Al Madinah Mushaf, you can learn and apply the rules of tajweed and improve your Quranic recitation.
