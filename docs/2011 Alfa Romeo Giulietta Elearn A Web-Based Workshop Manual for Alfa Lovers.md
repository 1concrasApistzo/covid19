Aside from Elearn, you may also want to know more about the features and specifications of your 2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta. The Giulietta is a stylish and sporty hatchback that offers a range of engines, trim levels, and options to suit different tastes and needs.
 
The 2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta was available with three engines: a 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol with 125 kW and 250 Nm, a 1.6-litre turbo-diesel with 77 kW and 320 Nm, and a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel with 125 kW and 350 Nm. All engines were paired with a six-speed manual transmission, except for the 2.0-litre diesel which had an optional six-speed dual-clutch automatic.
 
The 2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta came in three trim levels: Base, Distinctive, and Quadrifoglio Verde (QV). The Base model had standard features such as 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, cruise control, Bluetooth, rear parking sensors, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The Distinctive model added features such as 18-inch alloy wheels, leather seats, bi-xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights, and a Bose sound system. The QV model was the performance-oriented variant, with features such as a sporty body kit, lowered suspension, red brake calipers, sports seats, aluminium pedals, and a DNA system that allowed the driver to choose between three driving modes: Dynamic, Normal, and All-weather.
 
The 2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta had a five-star rating from Euro NCAP for its safety performance. It was equipped with seven airbags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, hill-start assist, and Alfa Romeo's Vehicle Dynamic Control system that monitored the vehicle's behaviour and intervened if necessary to prevent skidding or loss of control.
 
The 2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta was praised for its attractive design, agile handling, responsive engines, and generous equipment. However, it also faced some criticism for its tight rear seat space, limited rear visibility, firm ride quality, and high servicing costs. The Giulietta was discontinued in 2021 after more than a decade on the market.
