# How to Crack TacPack for FSX/P3D
 
TacPack is a popular combat system and development kit for FSX or P3D that adds realistic weapons, radar, countermeasures, and more to your flight simulation. However, it is not a cheap addon, and many users are looking for ways to crack it and enjoy its features for free. In this article, we will show you how to crack TacPack for FSX/P3D using a simple method that works for most versions of the software.
 
## What is TacPack?
 
TacPack is a product of Vertical Reality Simulations (VRS), a company that specializes in military flight simulation. TacPack enables true combat systems such as lethal weapons, radar, and radar warning receivers to be used in FSX/P3D against single or multi-player adversaries. It also allows you to spawn AI ships, refueling tankers, drones, and SAM sites directly into the simulation via an in-game menu. TacPack requires at least one TacPack-Powered aircraft (available separately) in order to utilize its tactical systems. There are many TacPack-Powered aircraft choices, such as the F/A-18E Superbug, the F-35 Lightning II, and the F-14 Tomcat.

## Why Crack TacPack?
 
TacPack is not a cheap addon. It costs $49.99 for each platform (FSX or P3D), and you need a separate license for each one. Moreover, you also need to buy one or more TacPack-Powered aircraft, which can cost another $40-$60 each. That means you can end up spending over $100 just to enjoy the full potential of TacPack. Many users find this price too high, especially considering that FSX and P3D are already old platforms that have been replaced by newer ones like MSFS 2020. Therefore, some users resort to cracking TacPack and using it without paying for it.

6. Run FSX or P3D as administrator. You should see a message saying "TacPack Activated" on the screen.
