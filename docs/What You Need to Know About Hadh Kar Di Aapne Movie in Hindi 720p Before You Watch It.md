- "Bahut soch samajh kar samajh samajh kar samajhdari ke saath hum dono milke duniya ko kuch aaisa samjhayenge ... ke soch samajh kar samajh samajh kar samajhdari ke saath duniya bhi yeh samajh jayegi ... ke soch samajh kar samajh samajh kar samajhdari ke saath hum dono ki samajhdari saath saath chal rahi hai ... aur soch samajh kar samajh samajh kar samajhdari ke saath hum dono ko joh bahut pehle kar dena chahiye tha ... woh soch samajh kar samajh samajh kar samajhdari ke saath hum dono ne baad mein kiya ... magar kiya zaroor ... samajh rahi hai na main kya samjhana chah raha hoon?" (After thinking a lot, understanding and with wisdom we two will make the world understand ... that after thinking, understanding and with wisdom this world will also understand ... that after thinking, understanding and with wisdom our mutual understanding is walking together ... and that after thinking, understanding and with wisdom what we two should have done long time back ... that after thinking, understanding and with wisdom was done by us later ... but it was done ... you are understanding right what I am trying to say?)
- "Joh karte hai woh bolte nahi ... joh bolte woh karte nahi ... joh garajte hai woh baraste nahi ... joh baraste hai woh garajte nahi ... lekin main karoonga bhi, bolunga bhi, garjunga bhi, barsunga bhi" (The people who do, don't talk ... the people who talk, don't do ... the people who shout, don't act ... the people who act, don't shout ... but I'll do, I'll talk, I'll shout, I'll act)
- "Aap log isse poochiye, iske dhadakte dil se poochiye ... zameen se poocho, aasman se poocho, hawaon se poocho, fizaon se poocho, andheron se poocho, ujalon se poocho, chaand se poocho, sitaron se poocho, aandhi se poocho, toofan se poocho ... mujhe se poocho, mere baap se poocho, isse poocho, iske baap se poocho, mere ghar ke char char cartoon se poocho ... arre main kehta hoon aur toh aur in pattiyon se poocho, in pattiyon ke peeche jalti hui battiyon se poocho, is bikhare hue kaleen se poocho, girre hue tambu se toote hue bamboo se poocho ... poocho us zarre zarre tinke tinke se kitna pyar kiya hai main ne isse?" (You people should ask her, ask her beating heart ... ask the ground, ask the sky, ask the wind, ask the atmosphere, ask the darkness, ask the brightness, ask the moon, ask the stars, ask the squall, ask the storm ... ask me, ask my father, ask her, ask her father, ask the four cartoons in my house ... infact I am saying that you should ask these leaves, ask the lights that are behind these leaves, ask this strewn carpet, ask this fallen shelter and broken bamboo ... ask every little thing and every drop how much have I loved her?)

The film also had some interesting trivia behind its making. According to director Manoj Agrawal in an interview with Bollywood Hungama [^4^], the original star cast of the film was Govinda and Mahima Chaudhry. However, due to date issues Mahima could not be a part of it and Rani Mukerji was roped in. He also revealed that Govinda had suggested him to make a film on multiple roles as he had done it before in Aankhen (1993) and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998). He also said that Govinda was very cooperative and supportive
