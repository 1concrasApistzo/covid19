## How to Process and Layer the Veh2 Soft Kicks Pack
 
The Veh2 Soft Kicks Pack already sounds great on its own, but you can also enhance and customize it with some simple processing and layering techniques. Here are some ideas on how to do that:
 
- **EQ:** You can use an equalizer plugin to shape the frequency spectrum of the kick samples. For example, you can boost the low-end to make them more powerful, cut the mid-range to reduce muddiness, or add some high-end to make them more crisp and bright.
- **Compression:** You can use a compressor plugin to control the dynamics of the kick samples. For example, you can apply a fast attack and release to make them more punchy, or a slow attack and release to make them more smooth and soft.
- **Reverb:** You can use a reverb plugin to add some ambience and space to the kick samples. For example, you can use a short reverb with a small room size to create a tight and intimate sound, or a long reverb with a large room size to create a wide and epic sound.
- **Layering:** You can layer two or more kick samples together to create a new and unique sound. For example, you can layer a low kick with a high kick to create a full and balanced sound, or layer a soft kick with a hard kick to create a contrast and interest.

To layer the kick samples, you can either use separate tracks or channels in your DAW or sampler plugin, or use a dedicated layering plugin such as [Serum](https://www.xferrecords.com/products/serum) or [Kickstart](https://www.kickstart-plugin.com/). You can then adjust the volume, pan, phase, pitch, filter, envelope, effects, and other parameters of each layer until you achieve the desired result.
