But what are the benefits of doing handstands every day? Why should you invest your time and energy in this challenging skill? Here are some of the reasons why handstands are good for your health and well-being:
 
## 1. They improve your blood circulation and lymph flow
 
When you do a handstand, you reverse the effects of gravity on your body. This means that blood flows more easily to your brain, heart, and lungs, which can improve your cognitive function, cardiovascular health, and respiratory capacity. Handstands also stimulate the lymphatic system, which is responsible for removing toxins and waste products from your tissues. This can boost your immune system and prevent infections and diseases.
 
## 2. They increase your concentration and focus
 
Doing a handstand requires a lot of mental effort and awareness. You have to pay attention to your alignment, breathing, and balance while being upside down. This can help you sharpen your concentration and focus, which can benefit your performance in other areas of life, such as work, school, or sports. Handstands can also help you clear your mind and reduce stress by shifting your perspective and releasing endorphins.
 
## 3. They strengthen your core and upper body
 
One of the most obvious benefits of handstands is that they make you stronger. To hold yourself up on your hands, you need to engage your core muscles, as well as your shoulders, arms, wrists, and upper back. These muscles are essential for many daily activities and movements, such as lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, and reaching. Handstands can also help you prevent injuries and improve your posture by strengthening the stabilizer muscles around your joints.
