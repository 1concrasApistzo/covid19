# How to Crack a Software by Modifying DLL Files
 
If you want to learn how a software protects itself from illegal copying, you will need to have some good knowledge of programming in Assembly language. This is a low-level programming language that is defined by a manufacturer specifically for a range of microprocessors to produce, after compilation, a machine language readable in hexadecimal form.
 
When you are ready, armed with some dedicated utilities, you will be able to examine how the DLL libraries called by this software work to dissect their sometimes complex protection mechanisms, and then modify them in such a way that you no longer need to register or buy this program to use it indefinitely and at your convenience.

In this article, we will show you the steps to crack a software by modifying DLL files using some tools such as IDA, dotPeek, or OllyDbg.
  
## Step 1: Learn Assembly Language
 
To be able to break the protection of a software, you will need to acquire a good understanding of what Assembly programming is. It is a low-level programming language that is defined by a manufacturer specifically for a range of microprocessors to produce, after compilation, a machine language readable in hexadecimal form.
 
Assembly language is very close to the hardware and allows you to manipulate registers, memory addresses, and instructions directly. It is also very fast and efficient, but it requires a lot of attention and practice to master it.
 
There are many resources online to learn Assembly language, such as tutorials, books, videos, and courses. You can also use an emulator or a simulator to practice writing and running Assembly code on different platforms.
  
## Step 2: Get the Necessary Utilities
 
To examine and modify the DLL files, you will need different tools, among others, a disassembler. A disassembler is a program that converts machine code into human-readable Assembly code. It allows you to analyze the structure and logic of the software and identify its protection mechanisms.

There are many disassemblers available online, some of them are free and some are paid. One of the most popular ones is IDA (Interactive DisAssembler), which supports many platforms and formats. You can download a free version of IDA from [this page](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/), compared to the Pro version, it is however limited.
 
You can also try dotPeek, a decompiler that supports DLL files and decompiles .NET Assembly code into C# [\[1\]](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/). Another option is OllyDbg, with which you can open DLL files for free and debug them [\[2\]](http://www.ollydbg.de/).
  
## Step 3: Open the Application in Your Disassembler
 
The procedure varies depending on the disassembler you use. You will need to locate the executable file of the software you want to crack and open it in your disassembler. This will show you which DLL files are loaded by the program. Use a debugging utility to see which functions are called by the DLL files [\[3\]](https://www.wikihow.com/Crack-Software-by-Modifying-DLL-Files).
 
You can also use a tool like Dependency Walker to view the dependencies of an executable file and see which DLL files it uses [\[4\]](http://www.dependencywalker.com/).
  
## Step 4: Look for a Counting Function
 
Many programs use an algorithm based on a software counter to protect themselves from copying, so that each time they are used, this counter reads the previous record in a file on the disk, performs a comparison with a value set by the code and then saves its new count after incrementing it. If the value read on the disk corresponds to the fixed value, the counter will no longer be able to increment and will lock the execution of the software.
 
Your goal will therefore be to find the code routine corresponding to this counting and make it inoperative. It is not certain at all that the protection algorithm of the program you want to crack corresponds exactly to this one, very
