## Step 2: Scan for Available Wifi Networks
 
The next step is to scan for available wifi networks in your area. To do this, click on the "Scan" button on the top left corner of the program window. The program will automatically detect your wireless adapter and start scanning for nearby wifi networks. You will see a list of wifi networks with their names (SSID), signal strength (RSSI), encryption type (WEP, WPA, or WPA2), and MAC address (BSSID).
 
Select the wifi network you want to hack by clicking on it. The program will show you some information about the selected network, such as its channel number, vendor name, authentication type (PSK or EAP), and key length (64 or 128 bits).

The program comes with a default wordlist called "wordlist.txt" that contains about 1 million words. You can find it in the program folder under "C:\Program Files\GreekWifi\wordlist.txt". You can also use your own custom wordlist by clicking on the "Browse" button and selecting a text file from your computer.
 
Once you have chosen your wordlist, click on the "Start" button to begin the attack. The program will start trying each word from the wordlist as a possible password for the selected wifi network. You will see a message saying "Trying Password: [word]" on the bottom left corner of the program window. You will also see how many words have been tested so far and how long it has taken.
