The 1928 Legacy Steinway Piano sounds very realistic and expressive. The samples are recorded with high quality and have a lot of dynamic range and variation. The round-robin sustains and staccatos add more realism and naturalness to the playing. The piano has a warm and resonant tone that works well for both solo and ensemble pieces. The library also captures the subtle nuances and noises of the piano, such as pedal noise, key noise, and string resonance.
 
The library also sounds very versatile and flexible. You can use the microphone options and effects to change the tone and mood of the piano. You can make it sound bright or dark, intimate or spacious, dry or wet. You can also use the presets and blending options to create different styles and genres of music.
