# Diana Krall's Glad Rag Doll: A Nostalgic Journey to the 1920s
 
Diana Krall is one of the most acclaimed jazz singers and pianists of our time. She has won five Grammy Awards, eight Juno Awards, and sold over 15 million albums worldwide. But for her 11th studio album, she decided to explore a different side of her musical heritage: the 78 RPM records she heard at home growing up in Nanaimo, British Columbia.
 
Glad Rag Doll (Deluxe Edition) is a collection of songs from the 1920s and 1930s, mostly written by Tin Pan Alley composers like Irving Berlin, Harry Warren, and Gus Kahn. These songs were popular in the era of vaudeville, speakeasies, and silent movies, and they reflect the joys and sorrows of life in those turbulent times. Some of them are upbeat and playful, like "We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye" and "You Know - I Know Ev'rything's Made for Love". Others are melancholy and haunting, like the title track "Glad Rag Doll" and "Lonely Avenue".

Krall collaborated with legendary producer T Bone Burnett, who has worked with artists like Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, and Robert Plant. Burnett brought along some of his regular musicians, including guitarist Marc Ribot and drummer Jay Belarose, to create a sparse and atmospheric sound that complements Krall's sultry voice. The album also features guest appearances by Costello (Krall's husband), guitarist Colin Linden, and violinist Stuart Duncan.
 
The deluxe edition of Glad Rag Doll includes four bonus tracks: an alternate version of "Glad Rag Doll", a cover of "Garden in the Rain" by Gene Austin, an alternate version of "There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of My Tears" by Bix Beiderbecke, and a live rendition of "All I Do Is Dream of You" by Gene Kelly.
