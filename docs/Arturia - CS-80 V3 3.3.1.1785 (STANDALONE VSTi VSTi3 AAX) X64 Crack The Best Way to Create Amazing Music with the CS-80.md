# How to Get the Legendary Sound of the Yamaha CS-80 with Arturia's Virtual Synthesizer
 
The Yamaha CS-80 is one of the most iconic synthesizers of all time, used by artists like Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Stevie Wonder, and many more. It was a beast of a machine, weighing 80 kilograms and featuring eight-voice polyphony, dual oscillators, ring modulation, and a ribbon controller. It also had a unique sound that was rich, warm, and expressive.

Unfortunately, the original CS-80 is very rare and expensive nowadays, and it lacks MIDI support and modern features. But don't worry, you can still get the legendary sound of the CS-80 with Arturia's virtual synthesizer, the CS-80 V3. This plugin faithfully recreates the original instrument, but also adds a modulation matrix, a multi-layer mode, and a host of effects and presets. You can also run it as a standalone application or as a VSTi, VSTi3, or AAX plugin in your DAW.
 
But how do you get the CS-80 V3 plugin? Well, you could buy it from Arturia's website for $199, or you could download it for free with a crack. A crack is a software tool that bypasses the copy protection of a program and allows you to use it without paying or registering. Sounds tempting, right? But before you do that, you should know that cracking software is illegal and risky. You could face legal consequences, damage your computer with viruses or malware, or lose your data or privacy.

You can also use the modulation matrix to create complex and dynamic modulations between different sources and destinations. And you can layer up to four different patches in the multi mode, creating huge and lush sounds.
